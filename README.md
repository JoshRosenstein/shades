# Shades!

This is an experimental CSS-in-JS library, designed to be very similar to Glamorous, but supports rendering styles to shadow dom (or anywhere else you want, really)

Further updates will be coming, but for now, please avoid using this until otherwise noted.

## Peer Dependencies

Please ensure you install all the peer dependencies that are mentioned by yarn/npm after installing this package, if any.  This will not work without them.
